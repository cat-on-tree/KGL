This pathway is activated by stressors like heart failure, inflammation, and sepsis. The progression of the disease is often attributed to the activation of MEK1, which leads to the phosphorylation of the MEK1 protein, inhibiting its function and reducing MAP kinase activity. \n\nThe primary hormone involved in this process is insulin. Insulin is released during stress and is critical for activating the MEK1 protein. Without MEK1 phosphorylation, insulin is not released, leading to the progression of the disease. \n\nThus, insulin is implicated in the activation of the MEK1-mediated MAP kinase pathway, which is key to the progression of Costello syndrome.\n\n**Answer:** Insulin is implicated in the activation of the MEK1-mediated MAP kinase pathway, crucial in the progression of Costello syndrome"}
