Gold supporting: The specific NCX inhibitor SEA0400 blocked SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, and decrease in cell viability.
LLM supporting:  SNP treatment caused an increase in (45)Ca(2+) influx. This increase in (45)Ca(2+) influx was blocked by SEA0400, but not the Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine.

Gold supporting: The process is mediated by the non-coding RNA X inactive specific transcript (Xist) that binds in cis and propagates along the inactive X chromosome elect, triggering chromosome-wide silencing.
LLM supporting:  Supporting sentence: The mechanisms by which Xist RNA binds and spreads along the chromosome, and initiates Xist-mediated chromosome silencing remain poorly understood.

Gold supporting: Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a genetically associated malignancy of haematopoietic stem cells, characterized by a t(9;22) translocation that forms the Philadelphia chromosome and creates a novel fusion gene, BCR-ABL.
LLM supporting:  Supporting sentence: The context does not explicitly mention BCR-ABL1 as the target of Imatinib. However, the question's answer (BCR-ABL1) is inferred from general medical knowledge about Imatinib's mechanism in Philadelphia-chromosome positive CML, even though the provided context does not directly state this.
