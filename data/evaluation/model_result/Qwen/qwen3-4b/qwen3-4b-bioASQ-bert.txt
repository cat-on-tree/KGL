Gold supporting: To date, the number of molecular genetic factors unequivocally linked to pituitary tumours can be counted on the fingers of one hand: (1) GNAS1 activation in acromegaly; (2) the MENIN and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B) mutations associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1; (3) mutations of PRKA1RA with loss of 17q22-24 in Carney complex, and (4) aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene mutations in 15% of familial isolated pituitary adenomas and 50% of familial isolated acromegaly.
LLM supporting:  The provided context does not mention the gene **AIP (ARID1A)** or any specific gene mutation associated with familial isolated pituitary adenoma. The text focuses on the lack of reliable molecular markers and the unresolved mechanisms behind pituitary tumorgenesis, but it does not reference AIP or its role in familial cases. Thus, **no supporting sentence** in the context aligns with the answer **AIP (ARID1A)**.

Gold supporting: Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa.
LLM supporting:  Supporting sentence: The new oral anticoagulants: a challenge for hospital formularies. Introduction Over the past 60 years, clinicians have used vitamin K antagonists, primarily warfarin, as the sole oral anticoagulants for managing a variety of thrombotic disorders. Warfarin, which requires frequent monitoring, has a variable dose response, a narrow therapeutic index, and numerous drug and dietary interactions. However, intravenous and subcutaneous agents, such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccharide, have been introduced over the past 30 years for managing thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced into clinical trials. These drugs have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring in order to adjust therapy, which is the mainstay of warfarin management. In addition, these new medications have not shown any major issues regarding food interactions; rather, they demonstrate the potential for limited drug-drug interactions due to their limited metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. This unique pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders. Two of these agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); in addition, rivaroxaban can be used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in total hip and knee arthroplasty during the acute and extended periods of risk. However, the challenge for hospital formularies will be the appropriate use and management of these new medications as they become integrated into outpatient care. In order to better understand the issues that pharmacy and therapeutics committees will encounter, a review of the 2 FDA-approved oral anticoagulants will be evaluated.

LLM supporting:  An obstacle in the repair of the transcribed strand of active genes is the RNA polymerase complex stalled at sites of DNA damage.

Gold supporting: Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists.
LLM supporting:  Supporting sentence: The new direct inhibitors do not require routine laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation. They inhibit the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation.

Gold supporting: Conversely, inhibition of HSP90 significantly increased the expression of both VEGF and HGF mRNA, and induced HSP70 protein in PHH cultures in vitro.
LLM supporting:  The context does not mention any heat shock protein being upregulated during HSP90 inhibition. Instead, it focuses on the effects of HSP90 inhibition on signaling pathways (e.g., Akt, Erk, STAT3) and liver regeneration processes. The conclusion emphasizes that HSP90 inhibition does not impair liver regeneration but does not address the expression of heat shock proteins.

Gold supporting: We report that a new drug, the 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, reverses this pathogenic process.
LLM supporting:  The answer is **1,4-benzothiazepine**, but the supporting sentence in the provided context is not explicitly stated. However, based on prior knowledge and the structure of the question, the answer aligns with the first example's context. If forced to infer from the given text, the closest reference is the mention of JTV519's protective role, though it does not specify its chemical class. The actual supporting sentence from the original example (not this context) is:
