Gold supporting: To date, the number of molecular genetic factors unequivocally linked to pituitary tumours can be counted on the fingers of one hand: (1) GNAS1 activation in acromegaly; (2) the MENIN and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B) mutations associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1; (3) mutations of PRKA1RA with loss of 17q22-24 in Carney complex, and (4) aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene mutations in 15% of familial isolated pituitary adenomas and 50% of familial isolated acromegaly.
LLM supporting:  The context provided does not mention the **AIP (aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein) gene** or its role in familial isolated pituitary adenoma. While the answer is factually correct in general biomedical knowledge (AIP mutations are indeed implicated in familial cases), **no sentence in the given context supports this specific claim**. The context focuses on the lack of reliable molecular markers and limited success in linking classical oncogenic mutations to sporadic pituitary tumors, but it does not address familial genetic causes like AIP.

However, the answer is inferred from general knowledge of CML pathophysiology and imatinib's mechanism, as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) in CML is characterized by the BCR-ABL fusion gene, and imatinib is a well-established BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The provided context focuses on clinical outcomes (hematologic/cytogenetic responses) rather than molecular mechanisms.
