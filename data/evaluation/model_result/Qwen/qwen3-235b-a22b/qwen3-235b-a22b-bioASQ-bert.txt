Gold supporting: To date, the number of molecular genetic factors unequivocally linked to pituitary tumours can be counted on the fingers of one hand: (1) GNAS1 activation in acromegaly; (2) the MENIN and p27Kip1 (CDKN1B) mutations associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1; (3) mutations of PRKA1RA with loss of 17q22-24 in Carney complex, and (4) aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene mutations in 15% of familial isolated pituitary adenomas and 50% of familial isolated acromegaly.
LLM supporting:  The context provided does not mention the **AIP (aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein)** gene or its association with familial isolated pituitary adenoma. The passage explicitly states that efforts to implicate classical proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor mutations in pituitary tumorigenesis have been largely unsuccessful and that no reliable molecular markers (including mutations) are currently identified.

LLM supporting:  The provided context does not mention the **AIP (aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein) gene** or its association with familial isolated pituitary adenoma.

LLM supporting:  Expression of HO-1 was also reduced in human cells when exposed to interferon-gamma or an iron chelator desferrioxamine, each of which induced Bach1 expression. In contrast, induction of HO-1 expression by CoCl(2) is associated with reduced expression of Bach1 mRNA. Thus, expression of HO-1 and Bach1 is inversely regulated. We have identified a Maf recognition element in the human HO-1 gene that is required for repression of a reporter gene by hypoxia and targeted by Bach1.
