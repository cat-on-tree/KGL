PC-14 / CDDP cells showed 8-fold resistance to cisplatin compared with the parental PC-14 cells as determined by dye formation [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTT] assay. In PC-14 / CDDP, but not PC-14 cells, augmentation of cytotoxicity was observed when a nontoxic concentration (10 mM) of JTV-519 was combined with the platinum compounds. Increased intracellular cisplatin accumulation was observed in PC-14 / CDDP cells in the presence of JTV-519 as measured by atomic absorption assay. Therefore, increased cisplatin accumulation was considered to be a possible mechanism underlying the reversing effect of JTV-519 on cisplatin resistance. These results suggest that JTV-519 is a potent agent reversing cisplatin resistance.

[...] we have demonstrated that BACH1 itself is regulated by Nrf2 [...] Furthermore, a functional ARE site [...] We conclude that BACH1 is a bona fide Nrf2 target gene and that induction of BACH1 by Nrf2 may serve as a feedback-inhibitory mechanism for ARE-mediated gene regulation.

Gold supporting: Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa.
LLM supporting:  Supporting sentence: The new oral anticoagulants: a challenge for hospital formularies. Introduction Over the past 60 years, clinicians have used vitamin K antagonists, primarily warfarin, as the sole oral anticoagulants for managing a variety of thrombotic disorders. Warfarin, which requires frequent monitoring, has a variable dose response, a narrow therapeutic index, and numerous drug and dietary interactions. However, intravenous and subcutaneous agents, such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccharide, have been introduced over the past 30 years for managing thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced into clinical trials. These drugs have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring in order to adjust therapy, which is the mainstay of warfarin management. In addition, these new medications have not shown any major issues regarding food interactions; rather, they demonstrate the potential for limited drug-drug interactions due to their limited metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. This unique pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders. Two of these agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); in addition, rivaroxaban can be used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in total hip and knee arthroplasty during the acute and extended periods of risk. However, the challenge for hospital formularies will be the appropriate use and management of these new medications as they become integrated into outpatient care. In order to better understand the issues that pharmacy and therapeutics committees will encounter, a review of the 2 FDA-approved oral anticoagulants will be evaluated.

LLM supporting:  Supporting sentence: Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of the bone and soft tissue, in which patients whose tumors have a poor histologic response to initial chemotherapy have a poor overall prognosis. Therefore, it is important to identify molecules involved in resistance to chemotherapy. We further show that EWS/FLI1 mediates upregulation of EYA3 via repression of miR-708, a miRNA that targets the EYA3 3'-untranslated region, rather than by binding the EYA3 promoter directly.

Gold supporting: Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a genetically associated malignancy of haematopoietic stem cells, characterized by a t(9;22) translocation that forms the Philadelphia chromosome and creates a novel fusion gene, BCR-ABL.
LLM supporting:  The question asks for the tyrosine kinase targeted by Imatinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML. While the context does not explicitly mention **BCR-ABL**, it provides the necessary framework to infer this answer. The context highlights that Imatinib resistance occurs in CML patients, particularly those with the Philadelphia chromosome (a hallmark of BCR-ABL fusion). This association is well-established in biomedical literature, where **BCR-ABL** is the canonical target of Imatinib.
