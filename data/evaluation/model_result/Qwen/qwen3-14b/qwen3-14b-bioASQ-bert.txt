Gold supporting: Nowadays, four new inhibitors of factor Xa are used orally (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban), and they are at least as efficient as heparins and vitamin K antagonists.
LLM supporting:  direct inhibitors of factor Xa: rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban.

Gold supporting: The process is mediated by the non-coding RNA X inactive specific transcript (Xist) that binds in cis and propagates along the inactive X chromosome elect, triggering chromosome-wide silencing.
LLM supporting:  Supporting sentence: The mechanisms by which Xist RNA binds and spreads along the chromosome, and initiates Xist-mediated chromosome silencing remain poorly understood.

Gold supporting: Here we show that a heme-binding factor, Bach1, is a critical physiological repressor of ho-1.
LLM supporting:  Supporting sentence: Gene targeting experiments in mice revealed that, in the absence of Bach1, ho-1 became expressed constitutively at high levels in various tissues under normal physiological conditions.

Gold supporting: Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a genetically associated malignancy of haematopoietic stem cells, characterized by a t(9;22) translocation that forms the Philadelphia chromosome and creates a novel fusion gene, BCR-ABL.
LLM supporting:  The context does not explicitly mention the specific tyrosine kinase targeted by Imatinib (Gleevec). The provided text discusses Imatinib resistance in CML patients and the efficacy of Dasatinib but does not identify the molecular target (e.g., BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase) of Imatinib. Therefore, **no sentence in the context supports the answer**.
