LLM supporting:  The importance of the Ca(2+)/calcineurin/NFAT signalling pathway for lymphocyte activation is underscored by the finding that the underlying defect in a family with a hereditary severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) syndrome is a defect in CRAC channel function, store-operated Ca(2+) entry, NFAT activation and transcription of cytokines, chemokines and many other NFAT target genes whose transcription is essential for productive immune defence.

LLM supporting:  The E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the interferon receptor type 1 (IFNAR1) is SCFβ-TrCP. This conclusion is supported by the context's statement that expression of Tyk2 stabilizes IFNAR1 in a manner independent of beta-Trcp, suggesting that beta-Trcp is the mediator when present, leading to the degradation of IFNAR1 through ubiquitination.

This conclusion is supported by the observation that Bach1-deficient mice exhibited impaired osteoclastogenesis, indicating that Bach1 is necessary for promoting this process. Additionally, the increased osteoclast formation when HO-1 was knocked down in Bach1(-/-) cells suggests that Bach1 normally facilitates osteoclastogenesis, further confirming its role as an activator.

Gold supporting: With the discovery of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) as a specific thyroid hormone transporter and the finding that mutations in this transporter lead to a syndrome of severe psychomotor retardation and elevated serum 3,3',5-tri-iodothyronine levels known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, the interest in this area of research has greatly increased.
LLM supporting:  In patients with Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome, the serum levels of thyroid hormones ( thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)) are typically normal. However, the transport of these hormones into target tissues, particularly the brain, is impaired due to a dysfunction in the thyroid hormone transporter MCT8. This results in tissue-level deficiency of active thyroid hormones, leading to neurological symptoms despite normal serum concentrations.
