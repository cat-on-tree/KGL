LLM supporting:  The answer is that alpha-spectrin and beta-spectrin subunits form antiparallel heterodimers. While the context doesn't explicitly state this, it is supported by the discussion of structural changes and dissociation under stress, which align with the known antiparallel arrangement of spectrin dimers.

LLM supporting:  using affinity-purified antibodies against XK and Kell proteins. Histological examination of the affected muscle revealed the typical pattern of McLeod myopathy including type 2 fiber atrophy. In control muscles, Kell immunohistochemistry stained sarcoplasmic membranes. XK immunohistochemistry resulted in a type 2 fiber-specific intracellular staining that was most probably confined to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, there was only a weak background signal without a specific staining pattern for XK and Kell in the McLeod muscle. Our results demonstrate that the lack of physiological XK expression correlates to the type 2 fiber atrophy in McLeod myopathy, and suggest that the XK protein represents a crucial factor for the maintenance of normal muscle structure and function.

LLM supporting:  BACH1 functions as a repressor. It negatively regulates the expression of HO-1, particularly in response to oxidative stress. This is evident from the context where Bach1-deficient cells show higher HO-1 levels, and Bach1 overexpression abolishes HO-1 induction, leading to increased ROS accumulation.

LLM supporting:  The context provided does not include a specific sentence that directly states transcription-coupled repair (TCR) targets the transcribed strand. However, based on general knowledge in molecular biology, TCR is known to specifically repair lesions on the transcribed strand of a gene because it is linked to the process of transcription. When RNA polymerase encounters a lesion, it stalls, triggering the repair machinery to act on the transcribed strand. Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention this, the answer is supported by established scientific understanding of TCR mechanisms.

The new direct inhibitors do not require routine laboratory monitoring of blood coagulation. They inhibit the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation.
