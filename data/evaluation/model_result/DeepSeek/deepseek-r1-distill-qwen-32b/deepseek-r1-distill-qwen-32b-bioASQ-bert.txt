Telcagepant acts as a CGRP receptor antagonist, which is effective in treating migraines by blocking CGRP activity.

LLM supporting:  The context provided does not explicitly state that alpha-spectrin and beta-spectrin subunits form antiparallel heterodimers. Therefore, there is no supporting sentence within the given context for this answer. The assertion about the antiparallel arrangement may be based on general biological knowledge rather than the specific details provided in the context.

LLM supporting:  The transcriptional regulator BACH1 exhibits both activating and repressive roles depending on the target gene. Specifically, in the context of osteoclastogenesis, BACH1 acts as an activator by promoting the expression of genes necessary for osteoclast differentiation. Conversely, in the regulation of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), BACH1 functions as a repressor, down-regulating its transcription. Thus, BACH1 is a transcriptional regulator with dual roles, acting as an activator in some pathways and a repressor in others.
